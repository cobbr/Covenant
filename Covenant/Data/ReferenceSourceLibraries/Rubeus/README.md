# Rubeus

----

Rubeus is a C# toolset for raw Kerberos interaction and abuses. It is **heavily** adapted from [Benjamin Delpy](https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi)'s [Kekeo](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/kekeo/) project (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license) and [Vincent LE TOUX](https://twitter.com/mysmartlogon)'s [MakeMeEnterpriseAdmin](https://github.com/vletoux/MakeMeEnterpriseAdmin) project (GPL v3.0 license). Full credit goes to Benjamin and Vincent for working out the hard components of weaponization- without their prior work this project would not exist.

Rubeus also uses a C# ASN.1 parsing/encoding library from [Thomas Pornin](https://github.com/pornin) named [DDer](https://github.com/pornin/DDer) that was released with an "MIT-like" license. Huge thanks to Thomas for his clean and stable code!

The [KerberosRequestorSecurityToken.GetRequest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.identitymodel.tokens.kerberosrequestorsecuritytoken.getrequest(v=vs.110).aspx) method for Kerberoasting was contributed to PowerView by [@machosec](https://twitter.com/machosec).

### Opsec Notes

This section covers some notes on the operational security of using Rubeus in an environment, with some technical examples comparing/contrasting some of its approaches to Mimikatz. The material here will be expanded in the future.

#### Overview

Any action you perform on a system is a detectable risk, especially when abusing functionality in "weird"/unintended ways. Rubeus (like any attacker toolset) can be detected in a number of methods, either from the host, network, or domain perspectives. I have a workmate who is fond of stating _"everything is stealthy until someone is looking for it"_ - tools and techniques generally evade detection because either a) people are not sufficiently aware of the tool/technique and therefore not even looking, b) people can not collect and process the data needed at the appropriate scale, or c) the tool/technique blends with existing behavior to sufficiently sneak in with false positives in an environment. There is much more information on these steps and detection subversion in general in [Matt Graeber](https://twitter.com/mattifestation) and [Lee Christensen](https://twitter.com/tifkin_)’s Black Hat USA 2018 [“Subverting Sysmon”](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Graeber-Subverting-Sysmon-Application-Of-A-Formalized-Security-Product-Evasion-Methodology.pdf) talk and associated [whitepaper](https://specterops.io/assets/resources/Subverting_Sysmon.pdf).

From the host perspective, Rubeus can be caught during initial [weaponization](#weaponization) of the code itself, by an abnormal (non-lsass.exe) process issuing raw Kerberos port 88 traffic, through the use of sensitive APIs like LsaCallAuthenticationPackage(), or by abnormal tickets being present on the host (e.g. rc4\_hmac use in tickets in a modern environment).

From a network or domain controller log perspective, since Rubeus implements many parts of the normal Kerberos protocol, the main detection method involves the use of rc4\_hmac in Kerberos exchanges. Modern Windows domains (functional level 2008 and above) use AES encryption by default in normal Kerberos exchanges (with a few exceptions like inter-realm trust tickets). Using a rc4\_hmac (NTLM) hash is used in a Kerberos exchange instead of a aes256\_cts\_hmac\_sha1 (or aes128) key results in some signal that is detectable at the host level, network level (if Kerberos traffic is parsed), and domain controller event log level, sometimes known as "encryption downgrade".

#### Weaponization

One common way attack tools are detected is through the weaponization vector for the code. If Rubeus is run [through PowerShell](#sidenote-running-rubeus-through-powershell) (this includes Empire) the standard PowerShell V5 protections all apply (deep script block logging, AMSI, etc.). If Rubeus is executed as a binary on disk, standard AV signature detection comes into play (part of why we [do not release](#compile-instructions) compiled versions of Rubeus, as brittle signatures are silly ; ). If Rubeus is used as a [library](#sidenote-building-rubeus-as-a-library) then it's susceptible to whatever method the primary tool uses to get running. And if Rubeus is run through unmanaged assembly execution (like Cobalt Strike's `execute_assembly`) cross-process code injection is performed and the CLR is loaded into a potentially non-.NET process, though this signal is present for the execution of any .NET code using this method.

Also, AMSI (the Antimalware Scan Interface) has been [added to .NET 4.8](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/11/28/announcing-net-framework-4-8-early-access-build-3694/). [Ryan Cobb](https://twitter.com/cobbr_io) has additional details on the offensive implications of this in the **Defense** section of his [“Entering a Covenant: .NET Command and Control”](https://posts.specterops.io/entering-a-covenant-net-command-and-control-e11038bcf462) post.

#### Example: Credential Extraction

Say we have elevated access on a machine and want to extract user credentials for reuse.

Mimikatz is the swiss army knife of credential extraction, with multiple options. The `sekurlsa::logonpasswords` command will open up a [read handle to LSASS](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/blob/a0f243b33590751a77b6d6f275313a4fe8d42c82/mimikatz/modules/sekurlsa/kuhl_m_sekurlsa.c#L168), enumerate logon sessions present on the system, walk the default authentication packages for each logon session, and extract any reverseable password/credential material present. **Sidenote**: the `sekurlsa::ekeys` command will enumerate ALL key types present for the Kerberos package.

Rubeus doesn't have any code to touch LSASS (and none is intended), so its functionality is limited to extracting Kerberos tickets through use of the LsaCallAuthenticationPackage() API. From a non-elevated standpoint, the session keys for TGTs are not returned (by default) so only service tickets extracted will be usable (the **tgtdeleg** command uses a Kekeo trick to get a usable TGT for the current user). If in a high-integrity context, a [GetSystem](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus/blob/4c9145752395d48a73faf326c4ae57d2c565be7f/Rubeus/lib/Helpers.cs#L55-L107) equivalent utilizing token duplication is run to elevate to SYSTEM, and a fake logon application is registered with the LsaRegisterLogonProcess() API call. This allows for privileged enumeration and extraction of all tickets currently registered with LSA on the system, resulting in base64 encoded .kirbi's being output for later reuse.

Mimikatz can perform the same base64 .kirbi extraction with the following series of commands:

    mimikatz # privilege::debug
    mimikatz # token::elevate
    mimikatz # standard::base64 /output:true
    mimikatz # kerberos::list /export

Mimikatz can also carve tickets directly out of LSASS' memory with:

    mimikatz # privilege::debug
    mimikatz # standard::base64 /output:true
    mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export

As "everything is stealthy until someone is looking for it", it's arguable whether LSASS manipulation or ticket extraction via the LsaCallAuthenticationPackage() API call is more "stealthy". Due to Mimikatz' popularity, opening up a handle to LSASS and reading/writing its memory has become a big target for EDR detection and/or prevention. However, LsaCallAuthenticationPackage() is used by a fairly limited set of processes, and creating a fake logon application with LsaRegisterLogonProcess() is also fairly anomalous behavior. However full API level introspection and baselining appears to be a more difficult technical problem than LSASS protection.

#### Example: Over-pass-the-hash

Say we recover a user's rc4\_hmac hash (NTLM) and want to reuse this credential to compromise an additional machine where the user account has privileged access. 

**Sidenote:** pass-the-hash != over-pass-the-hash. The traditional pass-the-hash technique involves reusing a hash through the NTLMv1/NTLMv2 protocol, which doesn't touch Kerberos at all. The over-pass-the-hash approach was developed by [Benjamin Delpy](https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi) and [Skip Duckwall](https://twitter.com/passingthehash) (see their ["Abusing Microsoft Kerberos - Sorry you guys don't get it"](https://www.slideshare.net/gentilkiwi/abusing-microsoft-kerberos-sorry-you-guys-dont-get-it/18) presentation for more information). This approach turns a hash/key (rc4\_hmac, aes256\_cts\_hmac\_sha1, etc.) for a domain-joined user into a fully-fledged ticket-granting-ticket (TGT).

Let's compare "over-passing-the-hash" via Mimikatz' `sekurlsa::pth` command verus using the `asktgt` command from Rubeus (or [Kekeo](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/kekeo/) if you'd like).

When `sekurlsa::pth` is used to over-pass-the-hash, Mimikatz first creates a new [logon type 9 process](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/blob/3d8be22fff9f7222f9590aa007629e18300cf643/mimikatz/modules/sekurlsa/kuhl_m_sekurlsa.c#L926) with dummy credentials - this creates a new "sacrificial" logon session that doesn't interact with the current logon session. It then opens the LSASS process with the ability to write to process memory, and the supplied hash/key is then [patched into the appropriate section](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/blob/a0f243b33590751a77b6d6f275313a4fe8d42c82/mimikatz/modules/sekurlsa/packages/kuhl_m_sekurlsa_kerberos.c#L566-L600) for the associated logon session (in this case, the "sacrificial" logon session that was started). This causes the normal Kerberos authentication process to kick off as normal as if the user had normally logged on, turning the supplied hash into a fully-fledged TGT.

When Rubeus' `asktgt` command is run (or Kekeo's equivalent), the raw Kerberos protocol is used to request a TGT, which is then applied to the current logon session if the `/ptt` flag is passed.

With the Mimikatz approach, administrative rights are needed as you are manipulating LSASS memory directly. As previously mentioned, Mimikatz' popularity has also led to this type of behavior (opening up a handle to LSASS and reading/writing its memory) being a big target for EDR detection and/or prevention. With the Rubeus/Kekeo approach, administrative rights are not needed as LSASS is not being touched. However, if the ticket is applied to the current logon session (with `/ptt`), the TGT for the current logon session will be overwritten. This behavior can be avoided (with administrative access) by using the `/createnetonly` command to create a sacrificial process/logon session, then using `/ptt /ticket:X /luid:0xa..` with the newly created process LUID. If using Cobalt Strike, using the **make\_token** command with dummy credentials and then **kerberos\_ticket\_use** with the ticket retrieved by Rubeus will let you apply the new TGT in a way that a) doesn't need administrative rights and b) doesn't stomp on the current logon session TGT.

It is our opinion that the LSASS manipulation approach is more likely (at the current moment) to be detected or mitigated due to the popularity of the technique. However the Rubeus approach does result in another piece of detectable behavior. Kerberos traffic to port 88 should normally only originate from lsass.exe - sending raw traffic of this type from an abnormal process could be detectable if the information can be gathered.

**Sidenote**: one way _both_ approaches can potentially be caught is the previously mentioned "encryption downgrade" detection. To retrieve AES keys, use Mimikatz' `sekurlsa::ekeys` module to return ALL Kerberos encryption keys (same with `lsadump::dcsync`) which are better to use when trying to evade some detections.


## Ticket requests and renewals

Breakdown of the ticket request commands:

| Command     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [asktgt](#asktgt) | Request a ticket-granting-ticket (TGT) from a hash/key or password |
| [asktgs](#asktgs) | Request a service ticket from a passed TGT |
| [renew](#renew) | Renew (or autorenew) a TGT or service ticket |


### asktgt

The **asktgt** action will build raw AS-REQ (TGT request) traffic for the specified user and encryption key (`/rc4`, `/aes128`, `/aes256`, or `/des`). A `/password` flag can also be used instead of a hash - in this case `/enctype:X` will default to RC4 for the exchange, with `des|aes128|aes256` as options. If no `/domain` is specified, the computer's current domain is extracted, and if no `/dc` is specified the same is done for the system's current domain controller. If authentication is successful, the resulting AS-REP is parsed and the KRB-CRED (a .kirbi, which includes the user's TGT) is output as a base64 blob. The `/ptt` flag will "pass-the-ticket" and apply the resulting Kerberos credential to the current logon session. The `/luid:0xA..` flag will apply the ticket to the specified logon session ID (elevation needed) instead of the current logon session.

Note that no elevated privileges are needed on the host to request TGTs or apply them to the **current** logon session, just the correct hash for the target user. Also, another opsec note: only one TGT can be applied at a time to the current logon session, so the previous TGT is wiped when the new ticket is applied when using the `/ptt` option. A workaround is to use the `/createnetonly:C:\X.exe` parameter (which hides the process by default unless the `/show` flag is specified), or request the ticket and apply it to another logon session with `ptt /luid:0xA..`.

Requesting a ticket via RC4 hash for **dfm.a@testlab.local**, applying it to the current logon session:

    C:\Rubeus>Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:dfm.a /rc4:2b576acbe6bcfda7294d6bd18041b8fe /ptt

### asktgs

The **asktgs** action will build/parse a raw TGS-REQ/TGS-REP service ticket request using the specified TGT `/ticket:X` supplied. This value can be a base64 encoding of a .kirbi file or the path to a .kirbi file on disk. If a `/dc` is not specified, the computer's current domain controller is extracted and used as the destination for the request traffic. The `/ptt` flag will "pass-the-ticket" and apply the resulting service ticket to the current logon session. One or more `/service:X` SPNs **must** be specified, comma separated.

The supported encryption types in the constructed TGS-REQ will be RC4_HMAC, AES128_CTS_HMAC_SHA1, and AES256_CTS_HMAC_SHA1. In this case, the highest mutually supported encryption will be used by the KDC to build the returned service ticket. If you want to force DES, RC4, or AES128/256 keys, use `/enctype:[RC4|AES128|AES256|DES]`.

Requesting a TGT for dfm.a and then using that ticket to request a service ticket for the "LDAP/primary.testlab.local" and "cifs/primary.testlab.local" SPNs:

## Constrained delegation abuse

Breakdown of the constrained delegation commands:

| Command     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [s4u](#s4u) | Perform S4U2self and S4U2proxy actions |


### s4u

The **s4u** action is nearly identical to [Kekeo](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/kekeo/)'s **tgs::s4u** functionality. If a user (or computer) account is configured for constrained delegation (i.e. has a SPN value in its msds-allowedtodelegateto field) this action can be used to abuse access to the target SPN/server. Constrained delegation is complex. For more information see [this post](http://www.harmj0y.net/blog/activedirectory/s4u2pwnage/) or Elad Shamir's ["Wagging the Dog"](https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html) post.

A **TL;DR** explanation is that an account with constrained delegation enabled is allowed to request tickets _to itself_ as any user, in a process known as S4U2self. In order for an account to be allowed to do this, it has to have **TrustedToAuthForDelegation** enabled in it's useraccountcontrol property, something that only elevated users can modify by default. This ticket has the **FORWARDABLE** flag set by default. The service can then use this specially requested ticket to request a service ticket to any service principal name (SPN) specified in the account's **msds-allowedtodelegateto** field. So long story short, if you have control of an account with **TrustedToAuthForDelegation** set and a value in **msds-allowedtodelegateto**, you can pretend to be any user in the domain to the SPNs set in the account's **msds-allowedtodelegateto** field.

This "control" can be the hash of the account (`/rc4` or `/aes256`), or an existing TGT (`/ticket:X`) for the account with a **msds-allowedtodelegateto** value set. If a `/user` and rc4/aes256 hash is supplied, the **s4u** module performs an [asktgt](#asktgt) action first, using the returned ticket for the steps following. If a TGT `/ticket:X` is supplied, that TGT is used instead.

A `/impersonateuser:X` parameter **MUST** be supplied to the **s4u** module. If nothing else is supplied, just the S4U2self process is executed, returning a forwardable ticket:

    C:\Rubeus>Rubeus.exe s4u /user:patsy /rc4:2b576acbe6bcfda7294d6bd18041b8fe /impersonateuser:dfm.a

    v1.3.3

    [*] Action: Ask TGT

    [*] Using rc4_hmac hash: 2b576acbe6bcfda7294d6bd18041b8fe
    [*] Using domain controller: PRIMARY.testlab.local (192.168.52.100)

    [*] Connecting to 192.168.52.100:88
    [*] Sent 230 bytes
    [*] Received 1377 bytes
    [+] TGT request successful!
    [*] base64(ticket.kirbi):

        doIE+jCCBPagAwIBBaEDAgEWoo...(snip)...


    [*] Action: S4U

    [*] Using domain controller: PRIMARY.testlab.local (192.168.52.100)
    [*] Building S4U2self request for: 'TESTLAB.LOCAL\patsy'
    [*] Sending S4U2self request
    [*] Connecting to 192.168.52.100:88
    [*] Sent 1437 bytes
    [*] Received 1574 bytes
    [+] S4U2self success!
    [*] Got a TGS for 'dfm.a@TESTLAB.LOCAL' to 'TESTLAB.LOCAL\patsy'
    [*] base64(ticket.kirbi):

        doIF2jCCBdagAwIBBaEDAgEWoo...(snip)...

That forwardable ticket can then be used as a `/tgs:Y` parameter (base64 blob or .kirbi file) to execute the S4U2proxy process. A valid **msds-allowedtodelegateto** value for the account must be supplied (`/msdsspn:X`). Say the **patsy@testlab.local** account looks like this:

    PS C:\> Get-DomainUser patsy -Properties samaccountname,msds-allowedtodelegateto | Select -Expand msds-allowedtodelegateto
    ldap/PRIMARY.testlab.local/testlab.local
    ldap/PRIMARY
    ldap/PRIMARY.testlab.local/TESTLAB
    ldap/PRIMARY/TESTLAB
    ldap/PRIMARY.testlab.local/DomainDnsZones.testlab.local
    ldap/PRIMARY.testlab.local/ForestDnsZones.testlab.local
    ldap/PRIMARY.testlab.local

Then the S4U2proxy abuse function (using the ticket from the previous S4U2self process) would be:

    C:\Rubeus>Rubeus.exe s4u /ticket:doIE+jCCBPagAwIBBaEDAgEWoo..(snip).. /msdsspn:"ldap/PRIMARY.testlab.local" /tgs:doIF2jCCBdagAwIBBaEDAgEWoo..(snip)..

    [*] base64(ticket.kirbi) for SPN 'ldap/PRIMARY.testlab.local':

        doIGujCCBragAwIBBaEDAgEWoo..(snip)..

Where `/ticket:X` is the TGT returned in the first step, and `/tgs` is the S4U2self ticket. Injecting the resulting ticket (manually with [Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:X](#ptt) or by supplying the `/ptt` flag to the **s4u** command) will allow you access the **ldap** service on primary.testlab.local _as if you are dfm.a_. 

The `/altservice` parameter takes advantage of [Alberto Solino](https://twitter.com/agsolino)'s great discovery about [how the service name (sname) is not protected in the KRB-CRED file](https://www.coresecurity.com/blog/kerberos-delegation-spns-and-more), only the server name is. This allows us to substitute in any service name we want in the resulting KRB-CRED (.kirbi) file. One or more alternate service names can be supplied, comma separated (`/altservice:cifs,HOST,...`).

Let's expand on the previous example, forging access to the filesystem on **primary.testlab.local** by abusing its constrained delegation configuration and the alternate service substitution. Let's package it all into one step as well, performing a TGT request, S4U2self process, S4U2proxy execution, and injection of the final ticket:

    C:\Rubeus>dir \\primary.testlab.local\C$
    Access is denied.

## Ticket Management

Breakdown of the ticket management commands:

| Command     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [ptt](#ptt) | Apply a ticket to the current (or specified) logon session |
| [purge](#purge) | Purge the current (or specified) logon session of Kerberos tickets |
| [describe](#describe) | Describe a ticket base64 blob or .kirbi file |


### ptt

The **ptt** action will submit a `/ticket:X` (TGT or service ticket) for the current logon session through the LsaCallAuthenticationPackage() API with a KERB_SUBMIT_TKT_REQUEST message, or (**if elevated**) to the logon session specified by `/luid:0xA..`. Like other `/ticket:X` parameters, the value can be a base64 encoding of a .kirbi file or the path to a .kirbi file on disk.

### describe

The **describe** action takes a `/ticket:X` value (TGT or service ticket), parses it, and describes the values of the ticket. Like other `/ticket:X` parameters, the value can be a base64 encoding of a .kirbi file or the path to a .kirbi file on disk.

If the supplied ticket is a service ticket AND the encryption type is RC4_HMAC, an extracted Kerberoast-compatible hash is output. If the ticket is a service ticket but the encryption key is AES128/AES256, a warning is displayed. If the ticket is a TGT, no hash or warning is displayed.

Display information about a TGT:

## Ticket Extraction and Harvesting

Breakdown of the ticket extraction/harvesting commands:

| Command     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [triage](#triage) | LUID, username, service target, ticket expiration |
| [klist](#klist) | Detailed logon session and ticket info |
| [dump](#dump) | Detailed logon session and ticket data |
| [tgtdeleg](#tgtdeleg) | Retrieve usable TGT for non-elevated user |
| [monitor](#monitor) | Monitor logon events and dump new tickets |
| [harvest](#harvest) | Same as monitor but with auto-renewal functionality|

**Note:** [triage](#triage)/[klist](#klist)/[dump](#dump) give increasing amounts of ticket detail.


### triage

The **triage** action will output a table of the current user's Kerberos tickets, if not elevated. If run from an elevated context, a table describing all Kerberos tickets on the system is displayed. Ticket can be filtered for a specific service with `/service:SNAME`.

If elevated, tickets can be filtered for a specific LogonID with `/luid:0xA..` or a specific user with `/user:USER`. This can be useful when triaging systems with a lot of Kerberos tickets.

### klist

The **klist** will list detailed information on the current user's logon session and Kerberos tickets, if not elevated. If run from an elevated context, information on all logon sessions and associated Kerberos tickets is displayed. Logon and ticket information can be displayed for a specific LogonID with `/luid:0xA..` (if elevated).

### dump

The **dump** action will extract current TGTs and service tickets if in an elevated context. If not elevated, service tickets for the current user are extracted. The resulting extracted tickets can be filtered by `/service` (use `/service:krbtgt` for TGTs) and/or logon ID (the `/luid:0xA..` parameter). The KRB-CRED files (.kirbis) are output as base64 blobs and can be reused with the ptt function, or Mimikatz's **kerberos::ptt** functionality.

**Note:** if run from a _non-elevated_ context, the session keys for TGTs are not returned (by default) from the associated APIs, so only service tickets extracted will be usable. If you want to (somewhat) workaround this, use the **tgtdeleg** command.

### tgtdeleg

The **tgtdeleg** using [@gentilkiwi](https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi)'s [Kekeo](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/kekeo/) trick (**tgt::deleg**) that abuses the Kerberos GSS-API to retrieve a usable TGT for the current user without needing elevation on the host. AcquireCredentialsHandle() is used to get a handle to the current user's Kerberos security credentials, and InitializeSecurityContext() with the ISC_REQ_DELEGATE flag and a target SPN of HOST/DC.domain.com to prepare a fake delegate context to send to the DC. This results in an AP-REQ in the GSS-API output that contains a KRB_CRED in the authenticator checksum. The service ticket session key is extracted from the local Kerberos cache and is used to decrypt the KRB_CRED in the authenticator, resulting in a usable TGT .kirbi.

If automatic target/domain extraction is failing, a known SPN of a service configured with unconstrained delegation can be specified with `/target:SPN`.

### monitor

The **monitor** action will monitor the event log for 4624 logon events and will extract any new TGT tickets for the new logon IDs (LUIDs). The `/interval:X` parameter (in seconds, default of 60) specifies how often to check the event log. A `/filteruser:USER` can be specified, returning only ticket data for said user. This function is especially useful on servers with unconstrained delegation enabled ;)

When the `/filteruser:USER` (or if not specified, any user) creates a new 4624 logon event, any extracted TGT KRB-CRED data is output.

Further, if you wish to save the output to the registry, pass the `/registry` flag and specfiy a path under HKLM to create (e.g., `/registry:SOFTWARE\MONITOR`). Then you can remove this entry after you've finished running Rubeus by `Get-Item HKLM:\SOFTWARE\MONITOR\ | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`.

**Note that this action needs to be run from an elevated context!**


### harvest

The **harvest** action takes [monitor](#monitor) one step further. It monitors the event log for 4624 events every `/interval:MINUTES` for new logons, extracts any new TGT KRB-CRED files, and keeps a cache of any extracted TGTs. On the `/interval`, any TGTs that will expire before the next interval are automatically renewed (up until their renewal limit), and the current cache of "usable"/valid TGT KRB-CRED .kirbis are output as base64 blobs.

This allows you to harvest usable TGTs from a system without opening up a read handle to LSASS, though elevated rights are needed to extract the tickets.

Further, if you wish to save the output to the registry, pass the `/registry` flag and specfiy a path under HKLM to create (e.g., `/registry:SOFTWARE\MONITOR`). Then you can remove this entry after you've finished running Rubeus by `Get-Item HKLM:\SOFTWARE\MONITOR\ | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`.

## Roasting

Breakdown of the roasting commands:

| Command     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [kerberoast](#kerberoast) | Perform Kerberoasting against all (or specified) users |
| [asreproast](#asreproast) | Perform AS-REP roasting against all (or specified) users |


### kerberoast

The **kerberoast** action replaces the [SharpRoast](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpRoast) project's functionality. Like SharpRoast, this action uses the [KerberosRequestorSecurityToken.GetRequest Method()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.identitymodel.tokens.kerberosrequestorsecuritytoken.getrequest(v=vs.110).aspx) method that was contributed to PowerView by [@machosec](https://twitter.com/machosec) in order to request the proper service ticket (for default behavior, [opsec table](#kerberoasting-opsec) for more detail). Unlike SharpRoast, this action now performs proper ASN.1 parsing of the result structures.

With no other arguments, all user accounts with SPNs set in the current domain are Kerberoasted, _requesting their highest supported encryption type_ (see the [opsec table](#kerberoasting-opsec)). The `/spn:X` argument roasts just the specified SPN, the `/user:X` argument roasts just the specified user, and the `/ou:X` argument roasts just users in the specific OU. The `/domain` and `/dc` arguments are optional, pulling system defaults as other actions do.

The `/outfile:FILE` argument outputs roasted hashes to the specified file, one per line.

If the the TGT `/ticket:X` supplied (base64 encoding of a .kirbi file or the path to a .kirbi file on disk) that TGT is used to request the service service tickets during roasting. If `/ticket:X` is used with `/spn:Y` then no LDAP searching happens for users, so it can be done from a non-domain joined system in conjunction with `/dc:Z`.

If the `/tgtdeleg` flag is supplied, the [tgtdeleg](#tgtdeleg) trick it used to get a usable TGT for the current user, which is then used for the roasting requests. If this flag is used, accounts with AES enabled in **msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes** will have RC4 tickets requested.

If the `/aes` flag is supplied, accounts with AES encryption enabled in **msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes** are enumerated and AES service tickets are requested.

If the `/rc4opsec` flag is specified, the **tgtdeleg** trick is used, and accounts **without** AES enabled are enumerated and roasted.

If you want to use alternate domain credentials for Kerberoasting (and searching for users to Kerberoast), they can be specified with `/creduser:DOMAIN.FQDN\USER /credpassword:PASSWORD`.

#### kerberoasting opsec

Here is a table comparing the behavior of various flags from an opsec perspective:

| Arguments     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **none** | Use KerberosRequestorSecurityToken roasting method, roast w/ highest supported encryption |
| **/tgtdeleg** | Use the **tgtdeleg** trick to perform TGS-REQ requests of RC4-enabled accounts, roast all accounts w/ RC4 specified |
| **/ticket:X** | Use the supplied TGT blob/file for TGS-REQ requests, roast all accounts w/ RC4 specified |
| **/rc4opsec** | Use the **tgtdeleg** trick, enumerate accounts _without_ AES enabled, roast w/ RC4 specified |
| **/aes** | Enumerate accounts with AES enabled, use KerberosRequestorSecurityToken roasting method, roast w/ highest supported encryption |
| **/aes /tgtdeleg** | Use the **tgtdeleg** trick, enumerate accounts with AES enabled, roast w/ AES specified |

### asreproast

The **asreproast** action replaces the [ASREPRoast](https://github.com/HarmJ0y/ASREPRoast/) project which executed similar actions with the (larger sized) [BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) library. If a domain user does not have Kerberos preauthentication enabled, an AS-REP can be successfully requested for the user, and a component of the structure can be cracked offline a la kerberoasting. For more technical information, [see this post](https://www.harmj0y.net/blog/activedirectory/roasting-as-reps/).

Just as with the [kerberoast](#kerberoast) command, if no other arguments are supplied, all user accounts not requiring with Kerberos preauth not required are roasted. The `/user:X` argument roasts just the specified user, and the `/ou:X` argument roasts just users in the specific OU. The `/domain` and `/dc` arguments are optional, pulling system defaults as other actions do.

The `/outfile:FILE` argument outputs roasted hashes to the specified file, one per line.

Also, if you wanted to use alternate domain credentials for kerberoasting, that can be specified with `/creduser:DOMAIN.FQDN\USER /credpassword:PASSWORD`.

The output `/format:X` defaults to John the Ripper ([Jumbo version](https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper)). `/format:hashcat` is also an option for the new hashcat mode 18200.

## Miscellaneous

Breakdown of the miscellaneous commands:

| Command     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [createnetonly](#createnetonly) | Create a process of logon type 9 |
| [changepw](#changepw) | Perform the Aorato Kerberos password reset |
| [hash](#hash) | Hash a plaintext password to Kerberos encryption keys |
| [tgssub](#tgssub) | Substitute in alternate service names into a service ticket |


### createnetonly

The **createnetonly** action will use the CreateProcessWithLogonW() API to create a new hidden (unless `/show` is specified) process with a SECURITY_LOGON_TYPE of 9 (NewCredentials), the equivalent of runas /netonly. The process ID and LUID (logon session ID) are returned. This process can then be used to apply specific Kerberos tickets to with the [ptt /luid:0xA..](#ptt) parameter, assuming elevation. This prevents the erasure of existing TGTs for the current logon session.

Create a hidden upnpcont.exe process:

    C:\Rubeus>Rubeus.exe createnetonly /program:"C:\Windows\System32\upnpcont.exe"

    [+] ProcessID       : 5352
    [+] LUID            : 0x4a091c0


### changepw

The **changepw** action will take a user's TGT .kirbi blog and execute a MS kpasswd password change with the specified `/new:PASSWORD` value. If a `/dc` is not specified, the computer's current domain controller is extracted and used as the destination for the password reset traffic. This is the Aorato Kerberos password reset disclosed in 2014, and is equivalent to Kekeo's **misc::changepw** function.

You can retrieve a TGT blob using the [asktgt](#asktgt) command.

    C:\Rubeus>Rubeus.exe changepw /ticket:doIFFjCCBRKgA...(snip)...== /new:Password123!

    [*] Received 167 bytes
    [+] Password change success!

### hash

The **hash** action will take a `/password:X` and optional `/user:USER` and/or `/domain:DOMAIN`. It will generate the rc4_hmac (NTLM) representation of the password using @gentilkiwi's **kerberos:hash** (KERB_ECRYPT HashPassword) approach. If user and domain names are specified, the aes128_cts_hmac_sha1, aes256_cts_hmac_sha1, and des_cbc_md5 hash forms are generated. The user and domain names are used as salts for the AES and DES implementations.

Calculating the rc4_hmac of a password:

    C:\Rubeus>Rubeus.exe hash /password:Password123!

    [*]       des_cbc_md5          : 614589E66D6B3792


### tgssub

The **tgssub** action will take a service ticket base64 blob/file specification and substitute an alternate service name into the ticket. This is useful for S4U abuse and other scenarios.

The `/altservice:X` flag is required and can either be a standalone sname (ldap, cifs, etc.) or a full service principal name (cifs/computer.domain.com). The latter is useful in some S4U2self abuse scenarios with resource-based constrained delegation. See Elad Shamir's [post on the topic](https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html) for more information.

The `/ptt` flag will "pass-the-ticket" and apply the resulting Kerberos credential to the current logon session. The `/luid:0xA..` flag will apply the ticket to the specified logon session ID (elevation needed) instead of the current logon session.

Executing the S4U2self/S4U2proxy proces to abuse traditional constrained delegation, and replacing the sname in the final ticket. This is so you don't have to execute the S4U process for a second time:

    C:\Rubeus>Rubeus.exe s4u /user:patsy /rc4:2B576ACBE6BCFDA7294D6BD18041B8FE /msdsspn:ldap/PRIMARY.testlab.local /impersonateuser:harmj0y /ptt

## Compile Instructions

We are not planning on releasing binaries for Rubeus, so you will have to compile yourself :)

Rubeus has been built against .NET 3.5 and is compatible with [Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532606&clcid=0x409). Simply open up the project .sln, choose "Release", and build.

### Targeting other .NET versions

Rubeus' default build configuration is for .NET 3.5, which will fail on systems without that version installed. To target Rubeus for .NET 4 or 4.5, open the .sln solution, go to **Project** -> **Rubeus Properties** and change the "Target framework" to another version.

### Sidenote: Building Rubeus as a Library

To build Rubeus as a library, under **Project** -> **Rubeus Properties** -> change **Output type** to **Class Library**. Compile, and add the Rubeus.dll as a reference to whatever project you want. Rubeus functionality can then be invoked as in a number of ways:


    // pass the Main method the arguments you want
    Rubeus.Program.Main("dump /luid:3050142".Split());

    // or invoke specific functionality manually
    Rubeus.LSA.ListKerberosTicketDataAllUsers(new Rubeus.Interop.LUID());


You can then use [ILMerge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=17630) to merge the Rubeus.dll into your resulting project assembly for a single, self-contained file.


### Sidenote: Running Rubeus Through PowerShell

If you want to run Rubeus in-memory through a PowerShell wrapper, first compile the Rubeus and base64-encode the resulting assembly:

    [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("C:\Temp\Rubeus.exe")) | Out-File -Encoding ASCII C:\Temp\rubeus.txt

Rubeus can then be loaded in a PowerShell script with the following (where "aa..." is replaced with the base64-encoded Rubeus assembly string):

    $RubeusAssembly = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load([Convert]::FromBase64String("aa..."))

The Main() method and any arguments can then be invoked as follows:

    [Rubeus.Program]::Main("dump /luid:3050142".Split())

Or individual functions can be invoked:

    $KerbTicket = 'do...' # base64-encoded ticket.kirbi
    $TicketBytes = [convert]::FromBase64String($KerbTicket)
    $LogonID = [Rubeus.LSA]::CreateProcessNetOnly("mmc.exe", $false)
    [Rubeus.LSA]::ImportTicket($TicketBytes, $LogonID)
